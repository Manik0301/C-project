### C++ Project: Object-Oriented Inventory Management System with File Handling  

This C++ project demonstrates the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) combined with file handling to create a simple billing system. The project allows users to manage items through basic functionalities such as:  

- Adding Items: Users can add new items to the system, which will be stored in a file for persistence.  
- Removing Items: Items can be deleted from the system, ensuring data updates.  
- Displaying Items: The system retrieves and displays all available items from the file.  
- Billing for Customers: Customers can select items, and the system generates a bill based on their purchases.  

### Key Features:  
Uses classes and objects to manage item details and billing logic.  
Implements file handling to store and retrieve item data.  
Provides a simple menu-driven interface for easy interaction.  

### Setup Instructions:  
1. Ensure you have a C++ compiler (such as g++) installed.  
2. Compile and run the program, ensuring the necessary item data files exist or are created during execution.  

This project is a great starting point for understanding OOP concepts in C++ while incorporating file handling for data storage and management.
